##Week 1 (Jan/12 - Jan/18)

### Restore IP Addresses

Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations. For example: Given ”25525511135”,
return [”255.255.11.135”, ”255.255.111.35”]. (Order does not maer)

### Generate Parentheses

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
"((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"

### Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
  ＊ All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
  ＊ Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
  ＊ The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7,

A solution set is:
[7]
[2, 2, 3]

### Word Search

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example,
Given board =

[
  ["ABCE"],
  ["SFCS"],
  ["ADEE"]
]
word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
