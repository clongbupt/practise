### Sort List
Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.

### Insertion Sort List
Sort a linked list using insertion sort.

### Reorder List
Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You must do this in-place without altering the nodes' values.

For example,
Given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}.

### Linked List Cycle
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

### Linked List Cycle II
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3

### Rotate List
Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2,
return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.

### Copy List with Random Pointer
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.
